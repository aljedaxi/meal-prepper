# has this ever happened to you?

my food delivery service only comes once a week, so i need to plan 4 a weeks worth of meals up front, and get the ingredients all at once, but copypasting everything into a shopping list sucks!

# running

clone this repo; run `yarn`, then `yarn dev`; export your trello board as json, then provide the file to the app.
